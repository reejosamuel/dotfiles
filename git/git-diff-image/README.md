git-diff-image
==============

This is an extension to 'git diff' that provides support for diffing images.
It can also be run as a direct CLI command for diffing two image files.

Platforms

Only macOS at the moment.  Patches welcome!

$ git diff

$ diff-image anImageThatHasChanged1.jpg anImageThatHasChanged2.jpg
# The same as above, only using files on disk not git differences.
```

Installation
------------

1. Install exiftool and ImageMagick.  (The script will cope with these missing,
but it's not going to be very exciting without them).

```bash
brew install exiftool imagemagick
```

2. Run `./install.sh`, which will configure your global git config for you.
It will tell you what it's done, so it should look something like this:

```bash
~/git-diff-image $ ./install.sh
+ git config --global core.attributesfile '~/.gitattributes'
+ touch '/Users/yourname/.gitattributes'
+ echo '*.gif diff=image' >>'/Users/yourname/.gitattributes'
+ echo '*.jpeg diff=image' >>'/Users/yourname/.gitattributes'
+ echo '*.jpg diff=image' >>'/Users/yourname/.gitattributes'
+ echo '*.png diff=image' >>'/Users/yourname/.gitattributes'
+ git config --global alias.diff-image '!f() { GIT_DIFF_IMAGE_ENABLED=1 git diff "$@"; }; f'
+ git config --global diff.image.command '~/git-diff-image/git_diff_image'
```
